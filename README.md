# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-Means-Clustering
This project focuses on applying K-Means clustering to perform customer segmentation. Customer segmentation involves categorizing a customer base into distinct groups based on certain characteristics. In this case, we use annual income and spending score as features to identify different customer segments.
